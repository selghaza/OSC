The main source file in the directory is sin.c
It was meant to be an interactive sound synthesizer where the position
of the mouse controls the frequency of the output sound. Unfortunately,
I was not able to implement this portion. When make is run, it generates
two executables, one called sin and the other sdl. sdl contains the logic
for recording mouse position, but I ran out of time and was unable to 
successfully integrate it into my main script, sin, which outputs the 
sound.

When you run ./sin it generates a sound evaulates using the following
function:
            sin(2*M_PI * 440 * tick++/sr);

Where tick is the iteration, and sr is the sample rate of jack.

The sound was contstructed by computing different sounds and storing them into
a 2D lookup table. The purpose of this is to give us an entire spectrum of 
oscillating sounds, which is the main idea behind our sound synthesizer.
Oscillating sound was created by evaluating sin/cos functions so that the 
values placed at each index can periodically repeat. The range of values used 
in the calculations were from [-1, 1). The index values in the 2D lookup table 
was calculated based on this range such that a value of 1.5 evaluates to -0.5. 
After the values were formulaically calculated, they were placed into their
respective position in the 2D table.
