The main source file in the directory is sin.c
It was meant to be an interactive sound synthesizer where the position
of the mouse controls the frequency of the output sound. Unfortunately,
I was not able to implement this portion. When make is run, it generates
two executables, one called sin and the other sdl. sdl contains the logic
for recording mouse position, but I ran out of time and was unable to 
successfully integrate it into my main script, sin, which outputs the 
sound.

When you run ./sin it generates a sound evaulates using the following
function:
            sin(2*M_PI * 440 * tick++/sr);

Where tick is the iteration, and sr is the sample rate of jack.
